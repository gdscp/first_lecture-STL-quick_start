# FIRST LECTURE
### C++ STL used in competitive Programming

This lecture is focused on the benefits of STL(Standard Template Library) of Cpp.
Also other languages have their own data structures that mimic the same behaviour as STL of Cpp,
so feel free to use other languages as well. 
This is because we are trying to teach when is the right time to use these data structures.

###### Each file gives some key usages of each of the most important STL in cpp
--> <stl_name>.cpp

###### There are example exercises asociated with the lessons too
-----------------------------------------------------
|   example_exrecise_1   |   vector + pair + deque  |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   example_exrecise_2   |   map                    |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   example_exrecise_3   |   bitset                 |
